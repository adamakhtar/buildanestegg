        <p class="mb-4">Retiring with a million dollars in the bank isn't as unreachable as most people believe. The secret is to regularly invest small amounts of money over a long period of time. For instance, if you invest $250 a month for 46 years in something which returns on average 7% you will earn yourself $1,000,000. $2,000,000 if you get a 9% return.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Investing might sound difficult especially when living as a foreigner in Japan but the good news is, with a little know how you can find low risk, low-cost ways to invest your money. You won't need to pay a costly financial advisor. Nor will you have to spend your weekends crunching through financial reports. You can start investing all by yourself and put everything on autopilot. I'll show you how later.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Still, you might be tempted to put this off for when you return home but procrastination will lose you money. Delay by a single year and the $1,000,000 above would shrink by $50,000! Or $120,000 if you delay by 2 years. So it's important to get started straight away.</p>
